%% Template Matlab script to create an BIDS compatible dataset_description.json file
% This example lists all required and optional fields.
% When adding additional metadata please use CamelCase
%
% Writing json files relies on the JSONio library
% https://github.com/gllmflndn/JSONio
% Make sure it is in the matab/octave path
